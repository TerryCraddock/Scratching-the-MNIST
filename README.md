# Scratching-the-MNIST
Very simple implementation of a neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, built from scratch using NumPy and core math operations without relying on machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Data - I could not include the data set directly here due to size limitations. However I will provide a link:
